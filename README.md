### Project Description
Turns your choice of a focus app to hell(or heaven if you're that good). Ctrl + Obey - Stay Focused or Else üòà
Get time as a reward, well what more to ask? üòà

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever find that random surge of motivation, where you feel you can take down the world with just a system?!
Random spike of energy, build a startup tech or reasearch about a paper, all in one go?!!
But heyy! But I'm switching windows/tabs in between(sounds familiar?). That's the problem!
And that's extacly where we come in! Just CTRL + Obey üòà


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Well, we have often heard nobody gets lost time back. Hmmmm, let's work on that then ;)
What about an app that let's you focus on one app entirely..? Hmm okay, already exists?
What about an app that let's you focus on one app entirely and if you switch app in between, well then you learn it the hard way üòà
Presenting the **Hell Blur**, where you will be challenged to exit it to return to your app(of choice?), but it ain't that easy!
Put together the clues, drag your mouse as far as you can, press any keys you like. One wrong move and you get one lost minute. Yes!
ONE LOST MINUTE IS ADDED TO YOUR PRO(blem)DUCTIVITY!
Well, until you exit and focus, it's your game! üòà
